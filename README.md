# Spinup Tweaser API

The *tweaser* is an API interface to creating, managing and responding to surveys.  It *teases* end users about new features and pulls information (*tweezes*) out of them that we might be otherwise unable to get.  Yeah, yeah I know... sorry. :D

It was written with MySQL as the backend using [Buffalo](http://gobuffalo.io), although it should support any database backend supported by Buffalo.  The *tweaser* doesn't have a frontend component.  That's on you to implement.  Currently, all administrative functions are managed through the `/v1/tweaser/admin/*` routes and authenticated with a PSK.  Responses are authenticated by a token generated by combining the user's ID, the ID of the question and a secret known only to the *tweaser*.  Responses are just posted to `/v1/tweaser/responses/{question_id}`.

# Concepts

The *tweaser* has a fairly hierarchical database model with `Campaigns`, `Questions`, `Answers`, and `Responses`.

## Campaigns

`Campaigns` are a logical collection of survey questions wrapped with a start date and an end date.  They also have a property to enable/disable the campaign without changing the dates.  A campaign `has_many` questions.

## Questions

`Questions` are the main construct that responders will interface with.  `Questions` have the text of the question, and a type (`single`, `multi`, `input`) and can be enabled/disabled.  A question `belongs_to` a campaign and `has_many` answers.

## Answers

`Answers` are the predefined responses to a question.  Answers are created administratively and have text and a type (`input`, or `choice`).  An answer `belongs_to` a question.
